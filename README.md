# Educamote
“Educamote” (education + remote) is a playful and interactive learning platform that keeps students and teachers connected.  We believe that staying connected and exploring new ways of teaching is the key to a trustful learning environment from everywhere, at any time, as real as possible. 

# Problem Statement:
“We need to bring learning to people instead of people to learning.” (Elliot Masie) The app is for students and teachers – therefore we identified two different problem statements. 
Challenge Students: Miss the daily school life and interaction with fellow students; Get distracted by too many app features; Need to be motivated. Challenge Teacher: Have no chance to reach each student from everywhere; Lack a tool to oversee the individual progress of each student.  

# Stay tuned !!!
